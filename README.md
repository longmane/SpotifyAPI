## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/longmane/SpotifyAPI/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/longmane/SpotifyAPI/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# API Basics
Many applications these days have Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. These allow a user with some basic web programming knowledge to use some of the app's functions and libraries and create custom features to suit their needs.
They utilize URIs to communicate after authenticating, allowing the custom code to make calls to the API functions.
This is incredibly useful for developers of third party applications need to pull data from or access the functionality of the application with the API.

# Working with the Spotify API
The Spotify API requires that the user first sets up OAuth.
